JumpGame
=====
This is a Bukkit/ Spigot Plugin containing a small Jump´n´Run minigame and I am still at developing.

Help is as usual appreciated. 

Todo List:
 - Language File , add an editable file for game text output 
 - GUI? , not sure how to do that at the moment, may or maynot be implemented
